# Spin Wheel Demo

## Important Notes
- **Not responsive**: tested only on **Asus laptop screen (1440) **.  

## Project Description
This is a simple **Spin Wheel** project where users can click the button to spin the wheel and win a prize.  

### Methods and Features Used
- **`setTimeout`**: Used to handle the spinning delay and display the prize after the wheel stops.  
- **`data-` attributes**: Used on each wheel section to store the prize name (`data-prize`) for easy access in JavaScript.  
- **`if` statements**: Used to prevent multiple spins at the same time and to correct the array index.  
- **DOM methods**: `.querySelector` and `.querySelectorAll` are used to select HTML elements and update the UI dynamically.  
- **CSS transitions**: Used to animate the rotation of the wheel smoothly.
